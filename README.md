The `netbird` chart has the following dependencies:

| Chart | Repository | Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cloudnative-pg` | `https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts` | `global.postgresql.cnpg.enabled` |

## Local Development

To test changes to the charts locally, you can use the `helm install --dry-run` command to render the templates without actually installing them. This is useful for debugging and verifying the output.

```bash
helm install my-release ./charts/netbird --dry-run > rendered-chart.yaml
```

You can also use a local Kubernetes cluster, such as [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), to test the charts in a real environment.
